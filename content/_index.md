DebConf18 will take place in Hsinchu, Taiwan in late July and early August.

DebConf is the annual developers' conference of the Debian project, one of the
largest Free Software projects worldwide.

Debian is non-commercial and vendor-independent. DebConf allows developers from
all over the world, who all volunteer their time, to gather once a year and
concentrate on the development and improvement of the Debian distribution.
